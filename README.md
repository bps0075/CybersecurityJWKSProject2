# Cybersecurity Project 2
## Name
* Brandon Sharp
## Goals
This program will extend the basic restful JWKS server. It already generates RSA key pairs and a web server with 2 handlers (GET and POST). It already serves HTTP on port 8080. Now the JWKS Server will be extended with the help of SQL Lite to prevent malicious SQL query manipulation, ensuring our authentication processes remain resilient and trustworthy.

## Parts
First the server file would run. Next, the client file or something like Postman can interact with the server file on port 8080. Then, the key generation occurs and a web server with 2 handlers (GET and POST) can be used.

## Compile (depends)
Build the project, and the run the project with JUnit involved. Something that may be neccessary is to install a certain packege if you do not have it.
