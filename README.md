# Cybersecurity Project 1
## Name
* Brandon Sharp
## Goals
This program will create a basic restful JWKS server. It will generate RSA key pairs and a web server with 2 handlers (GET and POST will) be created. It will serve HTTP on port 8080.

## Parts
First the server file would run. Next, the client file or something like Postman can interact with the server file on port 8080. Then, the key generation occurs and a web server with 2 handlers (GET and POST) can be used.

## Compile (depends)
Build the project, and the run the project with JUnit involved. Something that may be neccessary is to install a certain packege if you do not have it.
